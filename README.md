# **Ango (ÊöóÂè∑)**

Ango - **means code üßë‚Äçüíª in Japanese** - is a lightweight code distribution service built on Golang and Postgres. It's fully customisable and extensible to your needs.

## The Numbers
Ango has been load tested to death. That's what it's designed to do - handle huge volumes of load.
The setup was

## Use cases
Ango can be used for anything where you want a customer to make a request and recieve a unique code back (with no duplicates).
For example:
* Discount code distribution
* Gift card codes
* Referral codes
* One time passwords
* Ticket codes

## Concepts
Ango was designed to be flexible but has a reasonable opionated setup out of the box for easy install.
Below are the key concepts to familiarise yourself with.

### Codes
Codes are the primary place where we fetch and distribute codes from.
Codes can have certain rules associated with them (see below) and are associated with a particular batch and client.

### Batches
Often times with codes they are grouped into batches. For example, an ecommerce business may have a "Summer sale" and discount codes associated with that.
Batches are designed so that you can easily remove/expiry discount codes without having to know what each discount code is.
Batches are always associated with clients and can have one or more codes.

### Clients
Clients are **your** clients in **your** system. For example, if you are a ticketing business, you want to denote what codes are associated with which band that is performing - this would be marked with the client, with the performance being the "batch".

### Rules
Batches can have rules. These are super extensible, thanks to being JSON based.
Out of the box we have functionality to limit codes to N per customer and within a time limit. For example, 2 per customer every month.
This can be expanded but you will need to update the code in `checkRules`.

#### Sample Batch Record

Here's an example of a batch record with associated rules:
```
{
  "id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
  "name": "Summer Sale",
  "rules": {
    "maxpercustomer": 1,
    "timelimit": 30 // days - optional, defaults to unlimited
  },
  "expired": false
}
```


## Install / Setup
Locally, you can run Ango with docker compose:
```
docker compose up -d

# or in production
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Then you can run the migrations and seed the database:
```
make migrate
make seed
```

### To test
```
make test
```

### To create a migration
We use the db-migrate tool to manage migrations.
```
migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migrations -seq <name>
```


### Integrating in your app
Ango is designed to be whitelabel and unopionated. Here are some things you need to consider when integrating:
* You will need to perform authentication prior to calling Ango's API.
* Rate limiting is not included but can be added by you.
* Integration can be done by simply spinning up Ango and using the API.

### Redeeming codes
```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url http://your-ango-server/api/v1/code/redeem \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "batchid": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
  "clientid": "217be7c8-679c-4e08-bffc-db3451bdcdbf",
  "customerid": "50b0b41b-c665-4409-a2bb-a4fc18828dc2"
}'

# {
#  "code": "73619c34-e941-4384-bb98-3a2ff094ddd0"
# }
```

### Fetching batches
```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:3000/api/v1/batches

# [
#   {
#     "id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
#     "name": "Winter Batch",
#     "rules": {
#       "maxpercustomer": 1,
#       "timelimit": 30 // days
#     },
#     "expired": false
#   },
#   {
#     "id": "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222",
#     "name": "Summer Sale",
#     "rules": {
#       "maxpercustomer": 5,
#       "timelimit": 90 // days
#     },
#     "expired": false
#   }
# ]
```

### Importing Codes via CSV

You can import codes into Ango using a CSV file through the `/api/v1/codes/upload` endpoint. Here's how to use it:

1. Prepare your CSV file:
   - The CSV should have two columns: `client_id`, and `code`.
   - The first row should be the header row with these column names.
   - Each subsequent row should contain the data for one code.

2. Make a POST request to `/api/v1/codes/upload`:
   - Use multipart/form-data as the content type.
   - Include the following form fields:
     - `file`: Your CSV file
     - `batch_name`: The name of the batch you're creating
     - `rules` (optional): A JSON string containing the rules for this batch

3. Example using curl:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://your-ango-server/api/v1/codes/upload \
     -F "file=@/path/to/your/codes.csv" \
     -F "batch_name=Summer Sale 2023" \
     -F 'rules={"maxpercustomer":2,"timelimit":30}'
   ```

4. The server will respond with a success message if the upload is successful, or an error message if there's a problem.

Note: Ensure that your CSV file is properly formatted and that the client_ids in the CSV file exist in your system.
